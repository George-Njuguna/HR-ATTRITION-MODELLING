# **HR-ATTRITION-MODELLING USING RANDOM FOREST**
---
## **Project Overview**

**Employee attrition** refers to the gradual yet deliberate reduction in a company’s workforce, typically occurring when employees leave and are not replaced. This turnover can be **voluntary** (resignations, retirements) or **involuntary** (terminations, layoffs). While some attrition is natural, high or unmanaged attrition can significantly disrupt business operations.

Attrition can negatively impact a company’s **workflow**, **employee morale**, and **client satisfaction**. In severe cases, persistent attrition may even threaten a company’s ability to operate effectively or remain in business.

### **Common Causes of Employee Attrition:**

* Low or uncompetitive pay
* Desire for a different work environment
* Lack of work-life balance
* Poor management practices
* Inadequate growth opportunities or compensation

To prevent these issues from escalating, it's critical for companies to **monitor**, **analyze**, and **understand** the underlying reasons behind employee departures. This knowledge enables businesses to proactively implement strategies that foster retention and maintain productivity.

### **Project Objectives**

1. **Conduct a comprehensive attrition analysis** for the company to understand employee behavior and trends.
2. **Develop machine learning model** (Random Forest) to predict which employees are likely to leave and identify key factors influencing attrition.
3. **Provide actionable insights and recommendations** to reduce attrition based on analytical findings.
4. **Create an interactive dashboard** for the Human Resources (HR) department to visually track and monitor attrition trends in real time.

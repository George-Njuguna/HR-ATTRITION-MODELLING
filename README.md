# **HR-ATTRITION-MODELLING USING RANDOM FOREST**

## **Project Overview**

**Employee attrition** refers to the gradual yet deliberate reduction in a company’s workforce, typically occurring when employees leave and are not replaced. This turnover can be **voluntary** (resignations, retirements) or **involuntary** (terminations, layoffs). While some attrition is natural, high or unmanaged attrition can significantly disrupt business operations.

Attrition can negatively impact a company’s **workflow**, **employee morale**, and **client satisfaction**. In severe cases, persistent attrition may even threaten a company’s ability to operate effectively or remain in business.

### **Common Causes of Employee Attrition:**

* Low or uncompetitive pay
* Desire for a different work environment
* Lack of work-life balance
* Poor management practices
* Inadequate growth opportunities or compensation

To prevent these issues from escalating, it's critical for companies to **monitor**, **analyze**, and **understand** the underlying reasons behind employee departures. This knowledge enables businesses to proactively implement strategies that foster retention and maintain productivity.

### **Project Objectives**

1. **Conduct a comprehensive attrition analysis** for the company to understand employee behavior and trends.
2. **Develop machine learning model** (Random Forest) to predict which employees are likely to leave and identify key factors influencing attrition.
3. **Provide actionable insights and recommendations** to reduce attrition based on analytical findings.
4. **Create an interactive dashboard** for the Human Resources (HR) department to visually track and monitor attrition trends in real time.



## **Conclusions**

From our analysis, several key insights emerged regarding employee attrition:

* **Overall Attrition Rate**: The company’s attrition rate stands at **16.1%**, indicating that the majority of employees are retained.

* **Departmental Impact**: The **Research and Development** department has the highest attrition rate (**56.1%**), signaling a potential area of concern. Within job roles, **Laboratory Technicians** face the highest attrition at **26.2%**.

* **Travel Frequency**: Employees who **rarely travel** account for the highest attrition rate (**65.8%**), possibly reflecting dissatisfaction or job monotony.

* **Job Involvement**: Those with **low job involvement** (Level 1) are more likely to leave, with an attrition rate of **34%**, highlighting the importance of employee engagement.

* **Education Level**: Employees with the **lowest education level** have the highest attrition, suggesting that **higher educational attainment may be linked to better retention**.

* **Satisfaction Metrics**: Employees reporting **low satisfaction** in **job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, relationship satisfaction**, and **work-life balance** tend to have lower retention rates.

* **Feature Importance (Model Insight)**: According to the machine learning model, the top five features contributing to attrition are:

  * **Monthly Income**
  * **Age**
  * **Total Working Years**
  * **Monthly Rate**
  * **Daily Rate**

  Conversely, the **least important features** include:

## **Recommendations**

Based on these insights, the following actions are recommended to reduce attrition:

1. **Improve Employee Engagement**: Target employees with low job involvement through mentorship programs, growth plans, or role adjustments to boost commitment.

2. **Department-Specific Strategies**: Focus retention efforts on the **Research and Development** department and **Laboratory Technicians**, such as providing additional training, recognition, or career development paths.

3. **Review Compensation Structures**: Since **monthly income** is a top predictor of attrition, evaluate pay competitiveness and consider incentives for long-term retention.

4. **Address Work-Life Balance and Satisfaction**: Regularly assess employee satisfaction and implement initiatives such as flexible hours, wellness programs, or anonymous feedback systems.

5. **Personalize Development for Lower-Education Employees**: Offer career advancement programs or educational support to enhance retention among employees with lower educational backgrounds.
